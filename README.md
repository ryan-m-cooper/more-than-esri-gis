## Abstract
> Esri has and continues to be the leader in the market of geospatial technology. However, the
increased demand for spatial services alongside the rise of open source software has resulted in a glut of
non-Esri geospatial tools. The choice between these Esri and FOSS4G is sometimes framed as one or the
other. It doesnâ€™t have to be that way. I offer an overview of the FOSS4G landscape and some ways an
Esri shop might leverage open source software for its everyday mapping needs.
